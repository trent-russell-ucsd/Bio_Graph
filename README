Provided to you is the data for a public-domain breast cancer dataset 
(NCBI GEO ID:  GSE30682).  You can find out a little background on this by 
searching for it at the NCBI GEO website (GEO stands for ‘Gene Expression Omnibus’).  The dataset consists of two files:  1) the gene expression, and 2) the metadata.  

    Create some way to store both the expression data and associated meta-data.

    Develop a user-interface. We should be able to access the user-interface from our office.  At a minimum, the user-interface should be able to:

        Enable the user to select a gene of interest.

        Enable the user to make several choices of metadata from this list, e.g. age for example.

        Create some kind of visualization to show the user the value of the expression for a particular gene in addition to the selected metadata item across samples. 

    Be prepared to explain your choice of software technologies and interface design, e.g. what was the rationale, and more importantly what technologies do you think we would need to implement our vision?
